Welcome to Entropy! A mod where I add a bunch of cool looking stuff to the game!
That's best part about sandboxes, it doesn't have to have a theme, it's just whatever you want in a world.

What does this have so far!
3 weapons...
Obviously I plan on updating more, so look forward to more weapons!
The 3 weapons are all claymores. It is the Wooden Claymore (21 wood at a workbench), Copper And tin claymores (12 copper/tin at an anvil)
I like claymores, so i'm going to add a bunch of those, maybe a few cheat items for the cheaters, cuz that's fun.
